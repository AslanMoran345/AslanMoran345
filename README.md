# 👋 Hi, I’m Aslan-Gabriel 
A UX designer, researcher, and product thinker who applies structured investigation, ethical design principles, and evidence-based decision-making to create solutions that help real people — not just fill roadmaps.

* My background includes:*
- Independent UX research and full-scope product design
- Healthcare-focused user experience solutions
- Applied accessibility practices based on WCAG
- System-thinking, documentation, and structured exploration
- Human-centered learning in technology, design, and societal topics

I build with intention, clarity, and respect for users’ time, privacy, and cognitive load.

# 📌 What I Do
I explore and work across three core areas:

| UX Research & Product Design | Knowledge-Driven Content | Ethical & Responsible Digital Practice |
| --- | --- | --- |
| - // | - I write and maintain research-supported articles across multiple topics including: | - I focus on: |
| - Persona development ￮￮ Structured research studies ￮￮ Low → high fidelity prototyping ￮￮  Usability testing & reporting ￮￮ Evidence-based decision-making | - UX & technology ￮￮ Social thinking and human development ￮￮ Sexual health education ￮￮ Culture, creative interests, and personal study pathways | - Accessibility ￮￮ Legible communication ￮￮ Minimal distractions ￮￮ High utility and low complexity ￮￮ Respectful treatment of user data ￮￮ Transparent use of tools, including AI | 

- **All content is educational and cites references where applicable.**
- **No dark patterns. No manipulative optimization.**
- **If information isn’t beneficial, it doesn’t belong.**

- - -
 
| 🧠 My Guiding Approach | 
| :----: |
| Understand the human.
Understand the context.
Understand the constraints.
Design what is useful.
Document what is real. | 

#### Research comes first — features second.
#### I believe the design process loses integrity when executed backwards.

# ✍️ How I Learn & Work

I document my study pathways publicly. Many topics I cover are not approached with the intent of claiming expertise, but to demonstrate:

# 🔎 Transparency & Integrity

### AI may support:
- First-phase structuring
- Organization of research notes
- Drafting text

But every piece is **manually reviewed, rewritten, and aligned with my perspective, research, and tone.**
I never publish unverified output.

### Advertising
I do not allow:
- Malicious ads
- Pop-ups ads 
- Invisible tracking promotions
- Paid ads slipped into content

### If I ever use:
- Partner links
- My own product promotions
- Pixels for analytics

**Users will see a clear notice before data is collected.**

### Analytics
- Analytics (such as GA4) may be used to:
- Understand page performance
- Improve accessibility and clarity
- Optimize content reading experience

**No secret ad tracking, no surveillance-style third-party injections.**

# 🔧 Tools I Often Use

* Figma
* Qualitative & mixed-methods UX research
* Tailwind CSS (in demos and code examples)
* Google Fonts (in documentation)
* Markdown & structured documentation
* AI tools (with transparent disclosure)
